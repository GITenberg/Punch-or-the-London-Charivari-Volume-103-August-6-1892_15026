    <h2>DRURIOLANUS IN (MUSIC) AULIS.</h2>

    <p>The Augustan Age is to be revived at the new Palace Theatre
    of Varieties, late CARTE's English Opera House, for two of the
    imperial name of AUGUSTUS are foremost among the Directors of
    this new enterprise&mdash;which word "enterprise" is preferable
    to "undertaking." Sir AUGUSTUS leads; and GEORGIUS AUGUSTUS
    follows in the cast as Second Director,&mdash;with or without
    song is not mentioned. In comparison with this transformation
    of an Opera House into a Theatre of Varieties, no political
    combination of any sort or kind, no change either in the
    Ministry or in our home or foreign policy, is so likely to
    cause trouble to The Empire; <i>i.e.</i>, the Empire in
    Leicester Square.</p>

             alt="'AFTER THE OP'RA IS OVER.'" /></a>

        <h4>"AFTER THE OP'RA IS OVER."</h4>Sir Augustus
        Coventgardenensis, the Singing-Bird Showman, bows his
        Acknowledgments.
    </div>

    <p>We understand that Sir AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS, in addition to
    his interest in Covent Garden, Drury Lane, the Royal English
    Opera House, and various enterprises in town, country, and
    abroad, is about to turn his attention to other matters. <i>On
    dit</i> that he is in treaty for St. Paul's Cathedral,
    Westminster Abbey, and the City Temple, for a series of Sunday
    Oratorios. It is also not improbable that he may become, for a
    short time, Lessee of Exeter Hall, Buckingham Palace, and the
    Banqueting-hall of Hampton Court, for a series of Popular
    Picture-Shows. No doubt he will bring from Russia a new and
    entire Cosmopolitan Opera Company, to give a performance on the
    top of the Monument. Should there be an overflow, the audience
    turned away will be accommodated with seats in the Duke of
    York's Column. He is said to be in negociation for novelties
    for next year's London Season in various parts of the globe. It
    is possible that he may bring over the entire "World's Show"
    from Chicago, to give a solitary performance on an eligible
    spot recently acquired for this purpose in the neighbourhood of
    Primrose Hill. It is not unlikely that he may re-erect the
    ancient Pyramids at the back of Olympia, if satisfactory
    arrangements can be made with the Egyptian Government. Looking
    to the future, it is asserted that he has undertaken to accept
    the stage-direction of the next European War with those nations
    bound together in the Treaty of the Triple Alliance.
    Further&mdash;DRURIOLANUS MAXIMUS is considering the transport
    to London of the North Pole, laying the Zoological Gardens
    under contribution for a service of bears to climb it. Sir
    DRURIOLANUS mustn't overdo it. He holds a handful of cards, but
    he is so good a <i>prestidigitateur</i> that he is pretty sure
    to transform them into trumps. Likewise Sir DRURIO knows how to
    perform on the Trump of Fame.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>TOAST&mdash;We beg to propose the health of the
    liberal-minded purchaser of the Althorp Library, who intends to
    keep the books in a building open to all readers, adapting the
    toastmaster's phrase for the occasion, and giving, "Our Noble
    Shelves!"</p>

            <p>The Vultures, dear JOE? Nay, it needs no apology</p>

            <p>The Vultures are carrion-birds, be it said;</p>

            <p>Much as his decease was desired, he's alive,</p>

            fowls</p>

            <p>(in Ulster they're noisy, though some think they're

            <p>(They keep on repeating your chatter, you know,</p>

            <p>Then Geese, Jays, and Daws; yet they're birds of a
            feather,</p>

            <p>And they, my dear JOSEPH, <i>are</i> gathered
            together,</p>

            <p>To hiss, squeal and peck at the Party they'd
            foil,</p>

            <p>But who're like to secure&mdash;as you phrase
            it&mdash;"the spoil."</p>

            <p>Yes, these be the birds most <i>en évidence</i>
            now;</p>

            <p>And by Jingo, my JOE, they <i>are</i> raising a
            row.</p>

            <p>They're full of cacophonous fuss, and loud
            spite;</p>

            might.</p>

    <h2>A ROLLICKING SHOW.</h2>

    <p>In the International Horticultural Exhibition is, as
    advertised, "the Kiosk of the Australian Irrigation Colonies
    (CHAFFEY Bros.)." What fun the CHAFFEY Brothers must make of
    everything in the Exhibition! As long as the other exhibitors
    don't mind the chaff of the CHAFFEY Brothers, all will be
    harmonious. No doubt, round their Kiosk there are crowds all
    day, in roars of laughter, at the chaffing perpetually going
    on. The travelling Cheap Jack, were he in the building, would
    have some difficulty to hold his own against even one of the
    CHAFFEY Brothers, but pitted against an unlimited number of
    CHAFFEY Brothers, for their number is not stated in the
    advertisement, the unfortunate Cheap Jack would not be let, off
    cheaply. Apart from BUFFALO BILL, whose Show with a variety of
    novelties, is still a very big attraction, and the other
    amusements, this exhibit of CHAFFEY Brothers engaged in
    chaff-cutting, must be about one of the most attractive things
    in the Horticultural. By the way, in this same advertisement,
    there is a mysterious announcement "Stand 48." Of course, if in
    addition to their entertainment, they "stand 48 "&mdash;though
    with this vintage we are not acquainted; perhaps it should be
    '84 Pommery,&mdash;then the Brothers are simply <i>hors de
    concours</i>, and competition would be hopeless.</p>

    <p>Ulysses has been travelling again, and the record of his
    journeyings is set forth in <i>The Modern Odyssey</i>, which
    CASSELL &amp; Co. publish in one volume, with some charming
    illustrations in callotype.</p>

    <p>My Baronite notes a quaint disposition on the part of the
    old gentleman to begin at the very beginning. Thus, when he
    lands in New York, he furnishes a brief account of COLUMBUS,
    and how he came to discover America. The early history of
    Australia, and eke of China, are dealt with in the same
    instructive manner. This is all very well for ULYSSES, who
    comes fresh on the scene, and learns for the first time all
    about the Genoese, about Captain COOK, and how "a little more
    than a century ago eleven ships sailed from England," anchored
    in the Bay where now Sydney stands, and&mdash;strange to
    say!&mdash;did not find a populous city, but only green fields
    and a river running into the sea. <i>Pour nous autres</i>, age
    has somewhat withered the bloom of this story, and it might
    have been left peacefully slumbering in the Encyclopædias. But
    it can be skipped, and, for the rest, there will be found a
    swift succession of pictures of life and scenery in the Greater
    Britain that girdles the world. ULYSSES must have been much
    struck with the change since he first went a gipsying. But of
    that he discreetly says nothing.</p>

    <p>The "Triple Bill" still going strong at the Court. The
    <i>New Sub</i>, a smartly-written little One-Act Play, by
    SEYMOUR HICKS, notable for good performance all round, but
    especially for the rendering of <i>Mrs. Darlington</i>, by Miss
    GERTRUDE KINGSTON, of <i>Major Ensor</i>, by BRANDON THOMAS,
    and of <i>Second-Lieutenant Darlington</i>, by Mr. ERNEST
    BERTRAM&mdash;uncommonly Earnest BERTRAM. The Scene is in a Hut
    at Shorncliffe. Hutcætera. If <i>Lieutenant Crookendon's</i>
    catch&mdash;phrase about "a funny world" were repeated just
    about five times less frequently than it is, the piece, the

    </div>

    <p>At 9:10, appears <i>Faithful James</i>, represented by Mr.
    WEEDON GROSSMITH. It is a finished and quietly droll
    performance. The author, Mr. B.C. STEPHENSON ("B.C." makes him
    quite a classic&mdash;date uncertain, so his plot may have been
    done in collaboration, with PLAUTUS or TERENCE) has reproduced
    from the French a neatly-constructed One-Act piece, in which
    are all the possibilities of a Three-Act Criterion or Palais
    Royal Farcical Comedy. So rapid is the action, all over in
    about forty-five minutes, and so much to the point of the plot
    is the dialogue, that an inattentive auditor would soon lose
    the thread of the argument, never to pick it up again anywhere.
    Miss ELLALINE TERRIS is just that very <i>Mrs. Duncan</i>.
    BRANDON THOMAS is a breezy, brusque, and Admirable Admiral; and
    Mr. DRAYCOTT a hearty husband, very much in love with his
    pretty little wife. Mr. LITTLE makes much, perhaps almost a
    Little too much, of his small but essentially important
    part,&mdash;they are all important parts,&mdash;and of Miss
    SYBIL GREY can be said "<i>Nous savons Gré à Mlle. Sybil</i>."
    Mr. SIDNEY WARDEN's Character Sketch of the young and rather
    raw German Waiter, is excellent; the Waiter being "raw," is not
    overdone. Not a dull second in the farce. Will our B.C. Author
    give us some of his adaptations from PLAUTUS, TERENCE (some
    good old Irish plots of course, in the writings of this
    author), and a few other ancients with whom he was, it is most
    probable, personally and intimately acquainted. To think that
    the <i>Wandering Jew</i>, who can only sign himself "A.D.", is
    "not in it" in point of time with our STEPHENSON "B.C."!</p>

    <p>After this comes the <i>Pantomime Rehearsal</i>, which
    everybody should see, and which nearly everybody must have seen
    by this time. Success to the Triple Bill, which, in the
    political world, might mean Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT and WILLIAM
    GLADSTONE, the latter WILLIAM "counting two on a division."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>EXACT.&mdash;"He is something in the Church," said Mrs. R.,
    trying to describe the social position of a clerical friend of
    hers. "I forget what it is, but it's a something like
    'Dromedary;' only, you needn't smile, of course I know it
    couldn't be that, as a Dromedary has two humps on his back. Or,
    stop!" she exclaimed, suddenly, "am I confusing him with a
    Minor Camel?"</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>"The Yacht" Jersey.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>You will see <i>par mon adresse</i> that I am <i>encore une
    fois</i> on my travels! At present, in fact, the Channel
    Islands "claim me for their own," as <i>Lord Marmion</i> says
    in BULWER LYTTON. <i>Pardonnez-moi</i>, if I occasionally lapse
    into French, for <i>vraiment il y a</i> such a mixture of
    tongues that we might almost rename them the Babel
    Islands&mdash;even my noted Parisian accent is scarcely
    understood. <i>C'est étonnant</i>! and were it not for EULALIE,
    I should <i>quelquefois</i> be in a fix <i>agaçant</i>.</p>

    <p>I told you in my last letter that I should be unable to
    brighten Goodwood with the sunshine of my smile. But what is
    <i>Goodwood</i> compared to racing at <i>Jersey</i>? Indeed, it
    was unfortunate for Goodwood that the meetings clashed, and it
    should be avoided in future.</p>

    <p>It has been blowing hard for some few days, and we had
    rather a rough passage, and though the yacht was not a wreck,
    <i>I</i> was I am afraid, in spite of the compliment paid me by
    Mr. SPOOPENDYKE K. SIDNEY, the well-known American Four
    Millionnaire, who said he thought me "a real smart
    sailor!"&mdash;and he was very near the truth, too, for the
    salt water got in my eyes and they <i>did</i> smart; but I
    resolutely declined to go "below," and hung on to "the
    shrouds," I think they called them&mdash;a most unpleasantly
    suggestive name, when you are dreading a watery grave every
    moment. However, we got to our "moorings" at last (as
    <i>Othello</i> would call them), and having chartered the
    inevitable "sharry-bang" started for the course.</p>

    <p>By the way, <i>en passant</i> (I have not dropped into
    French for a long time), what a strange thing it is, that the
    moment you land at one of these islands you are immediately
    advised to proceed to another.</p>

    <p>I was told at Guernsey that I must on no account miss seeing
    "Sark." so I didn't&mdash;but was careful to observe it from a
    distance&mdash;for really, in these days of eruptions one
    doesn't know what might happen on such a volcanic-looking
    island!&mdash;and besides, I <i>always</i> carry a pocket
    "Ætna" in my dressing-bag, so that I can have a flare-up
    whenever I like. But let me see, where was I? Oh, yes!
    sharry-banging out to the races at Jersey. Well, really now,
    judging from some of the lovely toilettes worn by the Jersey
    "Daughters of Eve" (an old-established journalistic expression,
    and to my mind, most idiotic and insulting&mdash;we are
    <i>not</i> all tempting!)&mdash;they are in front of a good
    many of their Main-land sisters!&mdash;and the
    Hospitality&mdash;(always a capital H, I believe)&mdash;shown
    by the 1st South Lancashire Regiment is not to be beaten
    anywhere! The Lawn was well patronised, and the enthusiasm was
    tremendous&mdash;seven events&mdash;<i>all</i> over two miles,
    and <i>two</i> over hurdles, where <i>one</i> came down! What
    more <i>could</i> you want&mdash;together with a glorious day,
    "and all the fun <i>for</i> the Fair!"</p>

    <p>The great event of the day was "Her Majesty's Cup," for
    three years' old and upwards&mdash;(<i>one</i> went
    <i>downwards</i>)&mdash;and it was won, for the &mdash;th time
    in succession by <i>Jersey Lily</i> (I won't tell the exact
    number of times, as it is rude to hint at a lady's
    age)&mdash;amid a scene of excitement almost as big as the
    Eclipse at Sandown!&mdash;she was "followed home"&mdash;(racing
    expression&mdash;patented)&mdash;by <i>Lady Westhill</i> and
    <i>Lady Steephill</i>&mdash;so you see we were quite among the
    <i>haut-ton</i>&mdash;though some of us had never heard of
    these aristocratic thorough-breds before!</p>

    <p>And so the Jersey Goodwood is once more over!&mdash;and we
    have again from the springy turf of the Solent&mdash;(a most
    insecure footing)&mdash;caught in the flush of the sunlight the
    gleaming white sails of the vessels on the Goodwood
    Downs!&mdash;(this <i>may</i> sound a little wrong&mdash;but I
    prefer it to using a more stereotyped and matter-of-fact
    description).</p>

    <p>As to the racing of next week&mdash;I have not the faintest
    idea <i>where</i> it is, <i>what</i> it is, or <i>why</i> it
    is!&mdash;but such trifles do not disturb me, and I will
    proceed to my usual prophetic utterance on the event of the
    week!</p>

    <p>"MINIME!"&mdash;The other day the SPEAKER admitted that he
    couldn't remember the Latin for "Yes." What a lot of time,
    trouble, and money our own countrymen would be spared could
    they only occasionally forget that there is such a word as
    "Yes" in English! How many marriages, which have ended in
    misery, would never have come off but for this mischievous
    monosyllable! But to continue this is to be Hamletising, and to
    consider too curiously. For the SPEAKER to own it, stamps him
    as the genuine article, a Candid PEEL.</p>

    <p><i>Commencement of the Case.</i>&mdash;I am an enthusiast,
    and I am jotting down on this sheet of paper the story of my
    last exploit. A few days since I saw a dear little fellow in
    long clothes deserted by its mother, and took quite an interest
    in it. The next I hear of the sweet little boy is that he had
    been caught up by Dr. MARCELLUS and carried to his Home! Shall
    I permit this? No, from the view I had of the mother before she
    deserted the little lad (who, by the way, was called PITT
    WELLINGTON, after two statesmen recently deceased), I imagine
    she must have been a Reformed Revivalist of the New Connexion.

    <p><i>Written Seven Years later.</i>&mdash;I have found this
    document amongst the late Miss HEAVISIDES' papers. It is common
    knowledge that she took proceedings against Dr. MARCELLUS to
    produce PITT WELLINGTON. At the time of her death she had not
    succeeded. However, there is a fair sum mentioned in her will
    to carry her point. I drew the document myself at her
    dictation, and made it safe for the profession. There ought to
    be some nice pickings before "it is all over but the shouting,"
    as my ancient client, the late Lord DASHOVER, used to observe.

    <p><i>Added Four Years after.</i>&mdash;This case of PITT

    as trustee under the will I suppose I have no option, at least
    that is the opinion of Mr. RICHARD ROE. We are seeking to get
    Dr. MARCELLUS before the Court. After delays from various
    reasons the matter is now practically settled. Is PITT
    WELLINGTON to be brought up as a Reformed Revivalist of the New
    Connexion, or is he not? Well, we shall know soon.
    (<i>Signed</i>) JAMES BROWN, <i>Trustee and Executor under the
    Will of Miss</i> MARY HEAVISIDES.</p>

    <p><i>Added Five Years later.</i>&mdash;A great joke. Just
    found this paper in poor old Uncle JIM's strong box. How that
    case about PITT WELLINGTON did worry him! Five years ago, and
    still at the first stage! Nothing much could be done as Dr.
    MARCELLUS had taken PITT WELLINGTON out of the country.
    (<i>Signed</i>) TOM BOY, <i>Nephew to the late</i> JAMES
    BROWN.</p>

    <p><i>Added Two Years later.</i>&mdash;This paper commenced
    seriously and treated with levity by the last writer has fallen
    into our hands. As we find the note of one of our partners we
    add to it. The case of <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Marcellus</i> is
    still before the Court. The second Judge had to have the whole
    matter explained to him anew. It is a pity that there is not a
    law forcing occupants of the Bench to hear their own cases
    before they are allowed to retire. But that is beside the
    question. As to <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Marcellus</i>, we got the
    defendant before the Court and Mr. Justice ROBINSON has issued
    a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. We shall now have PITT
    WELLINGTON before us to see if he should be made a Reformed
    Revivalist of the New Connexion or not. By the way, as these
    proceedings were commenced some years ago, he must be becoming
    a fine boy by now! (<i>Signed</i>) JOHN DOE, <i>Junior Partner
    of the firm of</i> ROE, SONS, DOE, TOMPKINS AND DOE.</p>

    <p><i>Written after Another Year.</i>&mdash;Strange to find
    this paper full of notes. Well I may as well continue them, and
    put them back in the bundle from which I have taken them out.
    The bundle will tell its own story. It is full of summonses,
    copies of affidavits, draft instructions, and I know not what.
    It came out of the box marked <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Marcellus</i>.
    That's been a nice case. Fifteen years of it, and we are still
    waiting our turn in the list of the Court of Appeal. Not that
    we haven't been there before. Oh yes; we argued whether we had
    any right to take the matter before them. Strong Bar. Two Law
    Officers of the Crown on one side, and the Ex-Attorney and the
    Ex-Solicitor on the other. By the way, how the infant must be
    getting on! He must have taken to moustaches and a beard by
    this time! (<i>Signed</i>) BOBBY BINKS, <i>Clerk to Messrs.</i>
    ROE, SONS, DOE, TOMPKINS, DOE, SONS AND MARVEL.</p>

    <p><i>Written a Year later.</i>&mdash;This is really a most
    interesting find. So the cause of <i>Brown</i> v.
    <i>Marcellus</i> was commenced many many years ago! I know it
    had the reputation of being pretty ancient, but had no idea it
    was so old. Fancy, that I should write on the same page under
    the signature of my grandfather? Well, old Dr. MARCELLUS stood
    to his guns, and declared that we had no right to move in the
    matter at all. We were only a trustee under a Will, and it was
    not our matter. Then we ran through the Courts, Divisional,
    Appeal, right into the House of Lords. And the worthy Doctor
    won! However, BROWN's heir was a bit of a sportsman, and made
    him a Ward in Chancery. Just could do it, PITT WELLINGTON only
    in his twentieth year. That has put us right, Should go on
    straight now. (<i>Signed</i>) LUKE ROE, <i>Junior Partner
    of</i> ROE, SONS, DOE, TOMPKINS, DOE AND ROE.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Written after an indefinite Period.</i>&mdash;This is a
    most useful memorandum, as it gives an idea of what has been
    done hitherto. Our firm seems to have wisely kept the action
    open by paying the term-fee. As our late respected client's
    heir has for a son a young Barrister not in very large
    practice, I am not surprised that we are requested to continue
    the action. Of course, the son of our late respected client's
    heir, is to be briefed. Well, I dare say we shall be able to do
    something. Have perhaps quite a pleasant time of it. At any
    rate, we have made a move by taking out a summons before the
    Chief Clerk. (<i>Signed</i>) JAMES TOMPKINS, <i>Surviving
    Partner of Messrs.</i> ROE &amp; Co.</p>

    <p><i>Written Three Years after the last Entry.</i>&mdash;I am
    very glad I insisted upon looking through the papers when I
    accepted the brief in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Marcellus</i>. This
    paper is fairly accurate, save that it describes me as "a
    Barrister not in very large practice." That is a misstatement.
    I have been called only ten years, and yet last term I made
    enough to pay for my share of our Chambers and half the salary
    of our Clerk in common. Not in large practice, indeed! But to
    return to <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Marcellus</i>. We have done
    splendidly. We have been before the Courts, and taken it again
    up to the Lords. The contention I have held for the last three
    years is at last said to be correct. We have a right to the
    body of PITT WELLINGTON, and when we have brought that body
    before the Court, the Court will order it to be educated as a
    Reformed Revivalist of the New Connexion. I consider the
    establishment of this point a great forensic victory.

    </div>

    <p><i>Written Six Years later.</i>&mdash;After five years'
    diligent search, we have discovered the whereabouts of Mr. PITT
    WELLINGTON, according to the instructions furnished us by
    Messrs. ROE, NEPHEWS, TOMPKINS AND BACKGAMMON. We regret,
    however, to say that it will be impossible to carry out the
    instructions of the Court to produce him, that he might be
    brought up as a Reformed Revivalist of the New Connexion (a
    sect, we fancy, that disappeared some twenty years ago), as the
    alleged infant, the object of our search, died at the advanced
    age of ninety-two during the past summer. We add this mem to
    this paper, as the document seems to have reference to the
    matter we have in hand, and which now must ever be an
    incomplete suit. (<i>Signed</i>) HAND AND GLOVE. <i>Private

    <p><i>Final Endorsement.</i>&mdash;Messrs. DIGGE AND DELVE
    having had the honour to be commanded to make the necessary
    arrangements for the obsequies of the late Mr. PITT WELLINGTON,
    beg to say (on this memorandum) that they have not been
    fortunate enough to carry out the transaction to their entire
    satisfaction. Messrs. D. AND D. were able to ascertain the
    funeral rites of the Reformed Revivalists of the New Connexion
    (very poor and inexpensive rites), but have found out that the
    late Mr. PITT WELLINGTON himself placed a difficulty in their
    path. Messrs. D. AND D. have ascertained with regret that the
    late Mr. PITT WELLINGTON has been cremated, having died a

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
